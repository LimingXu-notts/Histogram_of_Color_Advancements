PREPARATIONS:
=============
* Download video databases
* Read frames from video data
* Background calculation and mask generation for each video
* Download library of background separation
* Tag videos for features, find best combination <hoc,dist, mu> for that and use a supervised learning to predict best combination


HOC:
====
* Color Histogram Peak Selection
* Using only bins from the full set that foreground is not zero in them
* HSV Space
* Add V channel of HSV space to RGB to have RGB-V space
* JND HOC
* Gridding using adaptive vertical projection
* Gridding only vertically (2x1, 3x1, 5x1)


DISTANCES:
==========
* Diffusion Distance
* Earth Mover Distance


MODEL UPDATE:
=============
* Model update: 5 recent frames
* Model update: Grid based update (averaging, weighted, beta dist, ...)


VISUALIZATION:
==============
* Visualize sliding window with box color indicating similarity to template and showing the ground truth position
* Similarity map and ranking works as alpha blend of the color
* Visualize the similarity of BB boxes and template as heat map, the similarity is the color of BB center


FURTHER PROCESSING:
===================
* Compare Each Distance measure over different HOC schemes, for intra and template
* Calculate inter to intra ratio for each combination (the smaller, the better)
